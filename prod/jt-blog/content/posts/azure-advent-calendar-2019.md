So right back at the beginning of September I was talking to Gregor Suttie on Twitter about a couple of Azure things like we normally do throughout the week, most weeks.

He then mentioned that he was working on something called the ‘Azure Advent Calendar’ and wondered if I would be up for contributing as a member of the #AzureFamily. And of course I jumped at the opportunity and committed to contributing on the on 1st of December to kick it all off.

The [Azure Advent Calendar](https://azureadventcalendar.com/) is an idea that has been brought to life by [Gregor Suttie](https://twitter.com/gregor_suttie) & [Richard Hooper (aka Pixel Robots)](https://twitter.com/Pixel_Robots) that will provide the chance for all members of the #AzureFamily to contribute a video and blog post about a topic of their choice related to the Azure Public Cloud.

Over the course of advent 2019, 75 videos and blog posts from the community will be shared from the following places:

- [YouTube – Azure Advent Calendar Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJL9wCcmeMBbah4J0uOWIPg)
- [The Official Azure Advent Calendar Website](https://azureadventcalendar.com/)
- [Twitter – Using The Hashtag: #AzureAdventCalendar](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AzureAdventCalender)

## So What Am I Contributing…?

This year I will be presenting an ‘Azure Governance 101’.

I will be covering the following topics/products/services:

Tags
Azure Governance Scopes
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Azure Management Groups
Azure Policy
And finally a demo of all of the above
The video will be available on the [Azure Advent Calendar YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJL9wCcmeMBbah4J0uOWIPg)  & here:

## Summary

This promises to be a great community event and my thanks go out to Gregor & Richard for coming up with the idea and arranging all the whole series!
